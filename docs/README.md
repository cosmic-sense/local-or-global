# Uncertainty of CRNS calibration

Use the following tool to assess uncertainty of CRNS-based estimates of soill water content (SWC).
The uncertainty is estimated for two calibration scenarios: 

- **local calibration** (blue line) is the standard approach for which SWC in the sensor footprint is estimated from soil sampling then
used to estimate a local value of N0.
- **general (or global) calibration** is based on an estimation of N0 from a large set of CRNS sensors across Europe.

The interactive tool should support you to decide which calibration strategy is preferable for your CRNS location.
